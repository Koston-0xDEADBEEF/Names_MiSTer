1. Take Manufacturer first.
2. If Manufacturer has more than 6 char, abbreviate with 4 first letters plus '.' (Ex: Nint. for Nintendo).
    Exception is done for "Nint Super Famicom", to avoid doing "Nint. SFC" as it only missed one char.
3. Then take system name.
4. If system name has variants that don't fit, remove the ones that don't fit. 
   The not fitting ones would be mentioned with "/..." if those are more than one. If "/..." doesn't fit either, omit entirely.
   If the non fitting variant is just one, try to include with an abbreviation or if that doesn't work, remove it.

   If system name does not fit abbreviate it with:
    a) acronym if possible (GBA)
    b) shortened descriptive word (TGFX16/CD) if that wasn't possible.
    c) core name if previous options weren't possible.
    d) abbreviation of core name if neither were possible.

5. If the core is a fork (LLAPI), save a char by using #, and try to fit the word describing the fork over system name.
