1. Manufacturer first if they apply (see next item).
2. Manufacturers are included ONLY when they seemed to belong to the system name. For example Atari 2600 or Commodore 64.
    Refer to official documentation of the system, to refer how it was commonly named.
    If official documentation is missing o unclear, refer to the title of its page on Wikipedia english version (or japanese in case of JP).
    If according to official documentation and wikipedia, the manufacturer name was commonly used, but doesn't fit (Texas Instruments), remove it.
3. Then system name.
4. If system name has variants that don't fit, remove the ones that don't fit. 
   The not fitting ones would be mentioned with "/..." if those are more than one. If "/..." doesn't fit either, omit entirely.
   If the non fitting variant is just one, try to include with an abbreviation or if that doesn't work, remove it.

   If system name does not fit abbreviate it with:
    a) acronym if possible (GBA)
    b) shortened descriptive word (TGFX16/CD) if that wasn't possible.
    c) core name if previous options weren't possible.
    d) abbreviation of core name if neither were possible.

5. If the core is a fork (LLAPI), save a char by using #, and try to fit the word describing the fork over system name.
